## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Replace TrendMonitor with the provided v2 TUI layout and keep axes/grid/scan sweep.
- [x] 1.2 Keep X-axis labels fixed as `-24H/-18H/-12H/-6H/NOW`.
- [x] 1.3 Update panel label to `Trend`.

## 2. Verification
- [ ] 2.1 Manual: confirm TrendMonitor renders with grid, scan sweep, axes, and fixed X-axis labels.
- [ ] 2.2 Manual: verify TrendMonitor still renders data from the Zion_Index daily series.
